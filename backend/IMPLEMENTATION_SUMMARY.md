## Quick Start

### 1. Generate Encryption Key

\`\`\`bash
cd backend
node generate-encryption-key.js
\`\`\`

### 2. Add to .env

\`\`\`env
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_generated_key_here
\`\`\`

### 3. Restart Server

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

### 4. Test Encryption

\`\`\`bash
# Send a message
POST /api/v1/messages
{
  "conversation": "conv_id",
  "type": "text",
  "text": "Test message"
}

# Retrieve messages - should see decrypted text
GET /api/v1/messages?conversation=conv_id
\`\`\`

### 5. Test Delete for Everyone

\`\`\`bash
# Delete your own message within 1 hour
DELETE /api/v1/messages/{message_id}/everyone
Authorization: Bearer {token}
\`\`\`

### Posts

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|

## Database Schema Changes

### Message Collection

\`\`\`javascript
{
  text: String,           // Encrypted text (maxlength increased to 10000)
  isEncrypted: Boolean,   // NEW: Encryption status flag
  isDeleted: Boolean,     // Deleted for everyone
  deletedAt: Date,        // When deleted
  deletedBy: ObjectId,    // NEW: Who deleted for everyone
  deletedFor: [ObjectId]  // Who deleted for themselves
}
\`\`\`

### Post Collection

\`\`\`javascript
{
  isDeleted: Boolean,     // NEW: Soft delete flag
  deletedAt: Date,        // When deleted
  deletedBy: ObjectId,    // NEW: Who deleted it
  deleteReason: String    // Why deleted
}
\`\`\`

## Testing Checklist

### Encryption Tests
- [ ] Send text message - verify encrypted in database
- [ ] Retrieve message - verify decrypted correctly
- [ ] Send system message - verify NOT encrypted
- [ ] Test with special characters
- [ ] Test with emojis
- [ ] Test with very long messages

### Delete for Everyone Tests
- [ ] Delete own message within 1 hour - should succeed
- [ ] Delete own message after 1 hour - should fail
- [ ] Try to delete others' messages - should fail
- [ ] Verify message removed for all participants
- [ ] Check deletedBy field is set correctly
- [ ] Test with multiple participants

### Delete for Self Tests
- [ ] Delete message for self - should succeed
- [ ] Verify message still visible to others
- [ ] Check deletedFor array contains user ID
- [ ] Test fetching messages excludes self-deleted ones

### Post Deletion Tests
- [ ] Author deletes own post - should succeed
- [ ] Admin deletes any post - should succeed
- [ ] Non-author/non-admin tries to delete - should fail
- [ ] Verify soft delete (post still in DB)
- [ ] Check status changed to 'removed'
- [ ] Test with delete reason

## Performance Considerations

### Encryption Impact
- Negligible performance impact on modern hardware
- Encryption/decryption happens in microseconds
- No noticeable latency in message sending/retrieval

### Recommendations
- ✅ Use pagination for message lists
- ✅ Index conversation and sender fields
- ✅ Consider caching for frequently accessed conversations
- ✅ Monitor encryption performance in production

---

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Deployments

If you have existing unencrypted messages:

1. **No migration needed!** - The system handles both:
   - Old unencrypted messages work as-is
   - New messages automatically encrypted

2. **Optional: Encrypt existing messages**
   \`\`\`javascript
   // Migration script example
   const Message = require('./src/models/Message');
   const { encrypt } = require('./src/utils/encryption');

   async function encryptExistingMessages() {
     const messages = await Message.find({ isEncrypted: false });

     for (const message of messages) {
       if (message.text && message.type !== 'system') {
         // Manually encrypt and update
         const encrypted = encrypt(message.text);
         await Message.updateOne(
           { _id: message._id },
           {
             $set: {
               text: encrypted,
               isEncrypted: true
             }
           }
         );
       }
     }

     console.log(\`Encrypted \${messages.length} messages\`);
   }
   \`\`\`

## Monitoring & Alerts

### What to Monitor

1. **Decryption Failures**
   - Alert if decryption error rate > 0.1%
   - May indicate key mismatch or data corruption

2. **Delete Patterns**
   - Monitor for suspicious mass deletion
   - Track deletion rate per user
   - Alert on unusual patterns

3. **Performance**
   - Track encryption/decryption time
   - Monitor message retrieval latency
   - Alert if > 100ms average

### Logging

Existing error logs capture:
- Encryption failures
- Decryption failures
- Unauthorized delete attempts
- Time limit violations

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Messages show encrypted text**
A: Check ENCRYPTION_KEY in .env is set correctly

**Q: Can't delete for everyone**
A: Verify you're the sender and within 1 hour

**Q: Performance slow**
A: Use pagination, check indexes, monitor query performance

### Getting Help

1. Check `ENCRYPTION_AND_DELETE_GUIDE.md`
2. Review API documentation at `/api-docs`
3. Check server logs for errors
4. Test with Swagger UI
