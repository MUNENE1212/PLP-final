### Phase 3: Narrative Creation ✅

**Three Strategic Narratives Created:**

#### 1. Investor Narrative
**File:** `.agent-workspace/artifacts/narrative-investors.md`

**Core Message:** "Live platform in massive underserved market with proven unit economics and defensible moats"

**ABC Framework:**
- **Care:** "Where's the real value transfer? Most marketplaces extract value. Dumu Waks transfers value."
- **Believe:** $150B market, live platform, 85% payout, AI moat, 12-18 month head start
- **Action:** "Schedule 30-minute demo this week to see live bookings"

**STORY Framework:**
- **Setting:** The $150B African informal sector with NO infrastructure
- **Tension:** Broken status quo for customers and technicians
- **Opportunity:** Dumu Waks LIVE with full-stack solution
- **Resolution:** Fair economics, data moat, first-mover advantage
- **Yes:** "Join us in building the category-defining platform"

#### 2. Technician Narrative
**File:** `.agent-workspace/artifacts/narrative-technicians.md`

**Core Message:** "Stop struggling. Start earning what you're worth. Jobs come to you."

**ABC Framework:**
- **Care:** "Will I make enough money this month? Some months 45K, some months 8K."
- **Believe:** 5-10 job requests daily, 80,000+ KES/month, automatic M-Pesa payment, portable reputation
- **Action:** "Sign up in 5 minutes, get first job requests within 24 hours"

**STORY Framework:**
- **Setting:** Master plumber with 12 years experience earning 35,000 KES/month unpredictably
- **Tension:** Wasted time, payment fraud, price pressure, no career growth
- **Opportunity:** Dumu Waks delivers consistent job requests, fair pay, guaranteed payment
- **Resolution:** Income stability (92,000 KES/month), professional recognition, career growth
- **Yes:** "Your future self will thank you. Say YES to Dumu Waks"

#### 3. Client (Customer) Narrative
**File:** `.agent-workspace/artifacts/narrative-clients.md`

**Core Message:** "Verified professionals, exact prices, guaranteed quality. Or your money back."

**ABC Framework:**
- **Care:** "10pm kitchen sink burst. Calling 7 plumbers who don't answer or quote 5K then charge 15K"
- **Believe:** <60 second matching, 4.2+ ratings, transparent pricing, escrow protection, real-time tracking
- **Action:** "Post your first job in 2 minutes, no commitment until you book"

**STORY Framework:**
- **Setting:** Emergency plumbing disaster at 10pm
- **Tension:** Hours of calling, unknown quality, price surprises, no-shows, no recourse
- **Opportunity:** Dumu Waks matches 3 verified plumbers in <60 seconds
- **Resolution:** Job fixed in 55 minutes, 7,800 KES (exact price quoted), slept soundly
- **Yes:** "Say YES to quality, transparency, and peace of mind"

### Phase 4: Strategic Guide & Implementation ✅

## The Strategic Narrative Approach

### Core Philosophy

**Old Way (Feature-Focused):**
❌ "We have AI matching"
❌ "99+ service types"
❌ "M-Pesa integration"

**New Way (Transformation-Focused):**
✅ "Get matched with the RIGHT technician in <60 seconds" (Customer outcome)
✅ "Earn 80,000+ KES monthly with consistent job requests" (Technician benefit)
✅ "Invest in live platform with proven unit economics in $150B market" (Investor opportunity)

### Why This Works

1. **Emotion Before Logic:** Connect emotionally (CARE), then build belief (BELIEVE), then call to action (ACTION)
2. **Specific Over General:** Real numbers, concrete examples, not vague promises
3. **Transformation Over Features:** Focus on what becomes POSSIBLE, not just what the platform HAS
4. **Proof Over Promises:** Ratings, testimonials, data, not marketing fluff
5. **Audience-Specific Voice:** Each narrative speaks directly to that audience's specific pains and desires
