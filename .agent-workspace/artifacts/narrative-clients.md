## ABC Framework: The Narrative Structure

### CARE (Why This Matters to Customers)

**The Story You Know Too Well:**

It's 10pm on a Tuesday. Your kitchen sink starts leaking. Water is spreading across your floor. You need help NOW.

What do you do?

**The All-Too-Familiar Struggle:**

You call the plumber whose number you've had for 2 years. No answer.

You call your neighbor. "Do you know a good plumber?" "Sorry, no."

You post on Facebook: "Anyone know a reliable plumber?" Crickets.

You search Google. Find a classifieds site from 2019. Call five numbers. Three don't answer. One says "I'll come tomorrow" - but tomorrow won't help you NOW. One says "Yes, I can come. It'll be 8,000 KES."

**And This is Just the START of Your Problems:**

When the plumber FINALLY arrives (3 hours late), you don't know if he's actually qualified. He might be someone's cousin who "knows about plumbing." He might do a terrible job. He might damage your property. You have NO way of knowing.

And the PRICE? He quoted 8,000 KES. But when he finishes, he says: "That's 8,000 KES for labor. Materials are extra. Transport is extra. It's actually 18,000 KES."

You're stuck. Your floor is wet. You can't say no. You pay.

And the work? Three weeks later, the pipe starts leaking AGAIN. You call him. No answer. Ghosted.

**The Real Costs:**

- **Financial:** You overpay for uncertain quality (8,000 KES becomes 18,000 KES, work fails, you pay again)
- **Time:** You waste hours calling, waiting, worrying, dealing with problems
- **Stress:** You're anxious about quality, safety, fairness - "Am I being ripped off?"
- **Risk:** Unqualified technicians can cause fires, floods, structural damage
- **Helplessness:** No recourse when things go wrong - you're on your own

**This Isn't Just About Finding a Plumber.**

This is about:
- **Protecting Your Home:** Your biggest investment is at risk from poor quality work
- **Protecting Your Business:** For business owners, downtime = lost revenue
- **Protecting Your Sanity:** The endless stress of unreliable service is exhausting
- **Protecting Your Wallet:** Hidden fees, poor quality, repeat repairs drain your money

**You Deserve Better.**

You deserve:
- **Reliable Service:** Qualified technicians who show up on time
- **Transparent Pricing:** Know EXACTLY what you'll pay BEFORE they start
- **Quality Assurance:** Verified reviews, ratings, and work history
- **Payment Security:** Pay AFTER work is completed to your satisfaction
- **Peace of Mind:** Know the job will be done right, or we'll make it right

**This is What Dumu Waks Does For You.**

## STORY Framework: The Narrative Flow

### S - SETTING THE STAGE

**A Relatable Nightmare:**

It's a Saturday morning. You wake up, walk to the kitchen, and step in a PUDDLE.

Your kitchen sink pipe burst overnight. Water is EVERYWHERE. Your cabinets are soaked. Your floor is damaged. And water is STILL gushing out.

**Panic Sets In:**

You turn off the main water valve. Now what? You need a plumber. IMMEDIATELY.

**The Search Begins:**

You call the plumber whose number you've had for 3 years. No answer. You call again. No answer.

You call your brother-in-law. "Do you know a good plumber?" "Sorry, no. Try asking on Facebook."

You post on your neighborhood WhatsApp group: "Anyone know a reliable plumber? EMERGENCY."

One person responds: "Try this number." You call. No answer.

Another responds: "My cousin is a plumber. Here's his number." You call. He says: "I can come on Tuesday."

It's Saturday. You can't wait until Tuesday. Your house is flooding.

**The Desperation:**

You call a number you found online. "Yes, I can come. It'll be 15,000 KES."

You don't know if this person is qualified. You don't know if 15,000 KES is fair. But you're desperate. You say "Okay."

Four hours later, he arrives. No uniform. No tools visible. No identification. Just some guy in a t-shirt.

He looks at the pipe. "This is bad. It'll be 25,000 KES."

You protest: "You said 15,000 KES!"

He shrugs: "Materials. Transport. It's complicated."

What choice do you have? Your house is flooded. You say: "Okay."

He fixes it. It takes him 2 hours. He doesn't clean up the water. He doesn't test for other leaks. He just leaves.

And 3 weeks later? The pipe starts leaking AGAIN.

**You call him. No answer. You text him. No reply.**

You call another plumber. "Who did this work? It's terrible. I need to redo everything. That'll be 30,000 KES."

So now you've paid 25,000 KES for bad work, AND you need to pay another 30,000 KES to fix it properly.

**Total: 55,000 KES.** **Three weekends of stress.** **Countless hours of anxiety.**

**And it ALL could have been avoided.**

---

### T - TENSION

**The Problems That Make Home Repairs a Nightmare:**

**Problem 1: The Search Game**
You call 7 plumbers. 3 don't answer. 2 say they're too busy. 1 says "maybe next week." 1 says "yes" but won't give you a price. You've wasted 3 hours and you're STILL without a plumber.

**Problem 2: The Quality Lottery**
Is this person actually qualified? Or just someone's cousin who "knows about plumbing"? Will they do a good job? Will they damage your property? Will they create a safety hazard? You have NO way of knowing.

**Problem 3: The Price Bait-and-Switch**
They quote 5,000 KES. When they finish, it's 15,000 KES. "Labor, materials, transport, complexity - it all costs extra." You're trapped. What choice do you have?

**Problem 4: The No-Show Nightmare**
You wait from 9am to 6pm on Saturday. They never show up. They don't call. They don't answer your calls. You wasted your entire day. Your problem is STILL not fixed.

**Problem 5: The Payment Risk**
If you pay upfront, what if they do terrible work? What if they don't finish? What if they damage your property? If you wait to pay, they might demand more money or refuse to leave. You can't win.

**Problem 6: The Recourse Void**
The work is terrible. The pipe is leaking again. You call the plumber. They ghost you. You call again. They block you. What do you do? You're on your own. No help, no refund, no recourse.

**Problem 7: The Emergency Panic**
It's 10pm. Something breaks. It's an emergency. Who can you trust to come NOW? Most people won't come. The ones who will charge 3x the normal rate because you're desperate. And you have no time to vet them - you just have to HOPE they're qualified.

**The Real Costs Add Up:**

- **Financial:** You overpay (5,000 KES becomes 15,000 KES), pay for poor quality (need to redo the job), deal with damage (water ruined your cabinets)
- **Time:** Hours calling, waiting, dealing with problems, fixing bad work
- **Stress:** Anxiety about quality, safety, fairness - "Am I being ripped off?"
- **Risk:** Unqualified work can cause fires, floods, structural damage - safety risks for your family
- **Helplessness:** No recourse, no protection, no one to help when things go wrong

**This Isn't Just Annoying. It's Outrageous.**

You're spending YOUR hard-earned money. You're letting a STRANGER into your HOME. You're trusting them with your BIGGEST investment.

And you have NO assurance of quality, NO price transparency, NO protection if things go wrong.

**The System is BROKEN. And It's Costing You:**

- **Money:** Thousands of shillings in overpayments and rework
- **Time:** Countless hours wasted on searches and problems
- **Stress:** Constant anxiety about every repair
- **Quality:** Living with poor repairs because you don't want to deal with it again

**You Deserve Better.**
