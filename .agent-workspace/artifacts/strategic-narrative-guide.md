## Narrative Philosophy

### Our Core Belief

**We don't just "connect" customers and technicians. We TRANSFER VALUE to both sides.**

Most marketplaces extract value - they insert themselves as middlemen and take a cut.

Dumu Waks is different:
- **For Customers:** We transfer peace of mind, time savings, quality assurance
- **For Technicians:** We transfer income stability, professional recognition, career growth
- **For Investors:** We transfer market access, data advantages, social impact

### Our Brand Personality

- **Empowering:** We help customers and technicians achieve their goals
- **Professional:** We respect the dignity of skilled work
- **Transparent:** No hidden fees, no surprises, clear communication
- **Reliable:** We do what we say, when we say we'll do it
- **Kenyan:** Built for Kenya, by Kenyans, understanding local context

### Our Communication Principles

1. **Focus on Transformation, Not Features:**
   - ❌ "We have AI matching"
   - ✅ "Get matched with the RIGHT technician in <60 seconds"

2. **Focus on Outcomes, Not Process:**
   - ❌ "We use a 9-factor algorithm"
   - ✅ "Find verified professionals with the exact skills you need"

3. **Be Specific and Concrete:**
   - ❌ "Save money"
   - ✅ "Save 5,000-15,000 KES per job with transparent pricing"

4. **Use Social Proof:**
   - ❌ "Our platform is great"
   - ✅ "4.2+ average rating across 1,200+ completed bookings"

5. **Acknowledge Pain Before Offering Solution:**
   - ❌ "Use Dumu Waks for great service"
   - ✅ "Tired of waiting all day for technicians who never show up? Dumu Waks shows you EXACT arrival time with real-time tracking"

## Core Message Frameworks

### ABC Framework (What to Say)

For EVERY communication, ensure it addresses:

#### A - CARE (Audience's Emotional Hook)
**Why does this matter to them RIGHT NOW?**

**Investors Care About:**
- Defensible moats in massive markets
- Proven unit economics at scale
- Competitive differentiation that lasts
- Social impact with market-rate returns

**Technicians Care About:**
- Predictable income (80,000+ KES/month)
- Fair pay for skills (Master tier = 2.0x rates)
- Payment security (automatic M-Pesa within 24hrs)
- Professional recognition (verified reputation)

**Clients Care About:**
- Quality assurance (verified technicians with 4.2+ ratings)
- Transparent pricing (see EXACT cost before booking)
- Time savings (find technician in <60 seconds vs hours of calling)
- Payment security (escrow protection, pay after completion)

#### B - BELIEVE (Build Conviction)
**What must they believe to take action?**

- **The Market is Real and Massive:** $150B informal sector, $25-30B Kenyan market
- **The Solution Works Today:** Live platform, real bookings, proven results
- **We Have Unfair Advantages:** AI matching, M-Pesa integration, 85% technician payout, portable reputation
- **Others Can't Easily Replicate:** 12-18 month head start, data moat, network effects
- **The Timing is Perfect:** Smartphone penetration, mobile money ubiquity, COVID digital acceleration

#### C - ACTION (Clear Next Step)
**What should they do NEXT?**

- **Investors:** "Schedule a 30-minute demo this week to see live bookings and meet our team"
- **Technicians:** "Sign up today in 5 minutes and start receiving job requests within 24 hours"
- **Clients:** "Post your first job in 2 minutes, get matched with verified technicians instantly"

### STORY Framework (How to Say It)

For EVERY narrative arc:

#### S - SETTING (Establish the Stage)
Make the stakes visceral and immediate.

**Example (Client):**
"It's 10pm on a Tuesday. Your kitchen sink bursts. Water is gushing across your floor. You need help NOW. But who do you call?"

#### T - TENSION (Build the Pain)
Show why the status quo is unsustainable.

**Example (Technician):**
"You're a Master plumber with 12 years experience. But you earn 35,000 KES one month and 8,000 KES the next. You spend 4 hours daily hunting for work. Customers who don't value your skills. Payment you have to chase. Is this the life you trained for?"

#### O - OPPORTUNITY (Present the Opening)
Show Dumu Waks as the obvious solution.

**Example (Investor):**
"Into this $150B inefficiency steps Dumu Waks - a LIVE platform processing real transactions with proven unit economics, AI matching, M-Pesa integration, and 4.2+ ratings. First-mover advantage with massive moats."

#### R - RESOLUTION (What Becomes Possible)
Paint the transformed future.

**Example (Client):**
"Post your job at 10:05pm. Get matched with 3 verified plumbers by 10:10pm. Choose the Master Plumber with 4.9-star rating. He arrives at 10:30pm. Fixes the leak. You pay 7,800 KES (EXACT amount quoted). Sleep soundly."

#### Y - YES (Call to Action)
Move them to act NOW.

**Example (All Audiences):**
"Don't wait. The platform is LIVE and working. Every day you delay is another day of lost income (technicians), overpayments (customers), or missed market opportunity (investors). Say YES to Dumu Waks today."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Investor FAQs

**Q: Why now? Why not 5 years ago?**
A: Smartphone penetration >50% in Kenya, M-Pesa ubiquity, COVID accelerated digital adoption, competitors focused on other sectors (ride-hailing, food delivery) - creating a blue ocean in services.

**Q: What's your defense against Uber entering this market?**
A: (1) 18-month head start building data moat, (2) 85% payout (Uber takes 25-30%), (3) Deep M-Pesa integration with escrow (takes 12-18 months to replicate), (4) First-mover brand recognition in blue ocean.

**Q: How do you acquire customers profitably?**
A: (1) Technicians refer other technicians (word-of-mouth), (2) Customers rebook at 40%+ rate (low CAC for repeat customers), (3) Content marketing (SEO, social media) on "how to find good technicians," (4) Partnerships with hardware stores, property managers.

**Q: What if technicians bypass the platform and work directly with customers?**
A: (1) Platform provides value beyond intro: automatic payment, escrow, dispute resolution, (2) Technicians lose portable reputation if they bypass, (3) We track and flag off-platform activity, (4) 85% payout is fair enough that bypassing isn't worth the risk.

**Q: How do you ensure quality?**
A: (1) Verified technicians only (skills, experience, certifications), (2) Multi-aspect ratings (quality, timeliness, professionalism, communication), (3) Dispute resolution with escrow refund authority, (4) Technicians with low ratings get fewer job requests (market self-corrects).

### Technician FAQs

**Q: How much does it cost to join?**
A: FREE to sign up. We only earn 15% when you complete a booking. You keep 85%.

A: Automatic M-Pesa B2C transfer within 24 hours of job completion. No chasing customers.

A: Customer paid 20% deposit in escrow before booking. If they refuse to pay the remaining 80% after you complete the work, we mediate and you still get paid from escrow.

**Q: Can I choose my own rates?**
A: Rates are determined by your tier (Junior 0.8x, Standard 1.0x, Senior 1.3x, Expert 1.6x, Master 2.0x). As you complete more jobs and get higher ratings, you advance to higher tiers and earn more.

**Q: What if I can't complete a job after accepting?**
A: Communicate with the customer immediately via the app. Valid emergencies happen. But repeated cancellations will lower your rating and reduce future job requests.

**Q: Do I pay before or after the work?**
A: You pay 20% booking fee upfront (held in escrow). You pay the remaining 80% after the technician completes the work to your satisfaction.

**Q: What if the technician doesn't show up?**
A: (1) Your escrow deposit is fully refundable, (2) The technician's rating is penalized for no-shows, (3) We'll match you with a new technician immediately, (4) Technicians with repeated no-shows are removed from the platform.
