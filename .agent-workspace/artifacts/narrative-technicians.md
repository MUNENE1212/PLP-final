## ABC Framework: The Narrative Structure

### CARE (Why This Matters to Technicians)

**The Reality You Know Too Well:**

You're a skilled professional. You've spent years learning your craft. Maybe you did an apprenticeship, maybe you went to a technical college, maybe you learned from your father. Either way, you're GOOD at what you do.

**But here's what keeps you up at night:**

**"Will I make enough money this month?"**

Some months you're busy - 40,000 KES, 50,000 KES. Other months? 8,000 KES. You can't plan. You can't save. You can't build a future.

And it's NOT because you're not skilled. It's NOT because you don't work hard. It's because:

- **Customers Can't Find You:** They call the same three plumbers everyone knows - the ones with big marketing or who happen to be neighbors with influential people. You're BETTER than them, but you're INVISIBLE.

- **You Waste Time Hunting for Work:** You spend 3-4 hours EVERY DAY calling people, posting on Facebook, asking hardware store owners for referrals. That's UNPAID time. Time you could be earning.

- **Customers Don't Value Your Skills:** "Can you do it for 3,000 KES? My cousin said he'd do it for 2,000." You take it because you need the money, even though it's not fair for your 8 years of experience.

- **Payment is NEVER Guaranteed:** You complete the job. The customer says "I'll pay you tomorrow." Then they ghost you. Or they say "I'm not satisfied, pay you half." You lose a full day's work AND the money.

- **Your Reputation Doesn't Travel:** You're the best plumber in your neighborhood. But if you move to the next town? No one knows you. You start from ZERO.

- **There's No Career Path:** You've been doing this 10 years. You're as good as anyone. But there's no way to "level up." You're just "the technician guy" forever. Same rates, same struggle, same uncertainty.

**The Emotional Toll:**

You're tired of:
- Feeling undervalued and disrespected
- Constant income anxiety
- Wasted time and effort
- Watching less-skilled workers get more jobs because they're "better known"
- Feeling like your skills don't matter

**You Deserve Better.**

You're a professional. You have valuable skills. You work hard. You should have:
- **Predictable Income:** Know you'll make 80,000+ KES every month
- **Fair Pay:** Get paid what you're WORTH based on your skills and experience
- **Respect:** Customers who recognize and value your expertise
- **Growth:** A path to increase your earnings over time
- **Freedom:** Choose the jobs you want, work when you want

**This is What Dumu Waks Does For You.**

## STORY Framework: The Narrative Flow

### S - SETTING THE STAGE

**The Skilled Technician's Reality:**

Imagine you're Peter. You're a Master plumber. You've got 12 years of experience. You've done it all - residential, commercial, industrial. You're GOOD. You take pride in your work.

**Your Day:**

You wake up at 7am. First thing you do: grab your phone and start calling. You have a list of 15 numbers - past customers, hardware store owners, people who said they "might have work."

You call 7 people. 4 don't answer. 2 say "not right now." 1 says "come look at it."

You get on your matatu (minibus) and travel 12km to the job. When you arrive, the customer says: "Oh, I found someone else. Sorry."

It's now 10am. You've wasted 3 hours and 150 KES in transport. Zero income.

You call 8 more people. Finally, someone says "Yes, can you come?" You travel 8km. You do the job - a simple pipe repair. You quote 5,000 KES (fair for your 12 years experience).

The customer says: "5,000? That's too much. My cousin said he'd do it for 2,000. Can you do it for 3,000?"

You're tired. You've wasted half the day. You need the money. You say: "Okay."

You complete the job. It's PERFECT - you're a Master plumber, of course it's perfect. The customer is happy.

You say: "Payment?" They say: "Oh, I don't have cash right now. Let me send you via M-Pesa tomorrow."

Tomorrow comes. No M-Pesa. You call. No answer. You call again. They pick up: "Oh, I'm not happy with the work. There's a small leak. I'll pay you 2,000."

You ARGUE. You BEG. Finally, they send 3,000 KES. For a 5,000 KES job that you quoted down to 3,000 KES.

It's now 6pm. You've earned 3,000 KES. You spent 300 KES on transport. You wasted 8 hours. You're exhausted. You're frustrated. You're thinking: *"I'm a Master plumber with 12 years experience. Why am I living like this?"*

**The Worse Part:**

This isn't one bad day. This is EVERY DAY.

Some weeks are better - you make 25,000 KES. Some weeks are worse - you make 8,000 KES. You can't plan. You can't save. You can't pay your rent consistently.

You have skills. You have experience. You have pride in your work.

**But the system is BROKEN.**

---

### T - TENSION

**The Problems That Keep You Up at Night:**

**Problem 1: Invisible Skills**
You're a fantastic plumber. But customers can't FIND you. They call the same three plumbers everyone knows - not because they're better, but because they're MORE VISIBLE. You're invisible despite your skills.

**Problem 2: Wasted Time**
You spend 3-4 hours EVERY DAY calling people, posting on Facebook, begging for work. That's UNPAID time. Time you could be earning. Time away from your family.

**Problem 3: Payment Fraud**
You do the work. Customer promises to pay. Then they ghost you. Or they complain to pay less. You lose DAYS of work and THOUSANDS of shillings.

**Problem 4: Price Pressure**
Customers don't understand your skills. "Can you do it for 3,000 KES? My cousin said he'd do it for 2,000." You take it because you need the money - but it's not FAIR for your expertise.

**Problem 5: Reputation Isolation**
You're the best in your neighborhood. But if you move to the next town? No one knows you. Your reputation doesn't travel. You start from ZERO.

**Problem 6: Career Ceiling**
You've been doing this 12 years. You're as good as anyone. But there's no way to ADVANCE. No promotions. No raises. No career path. You're stuck.

**Problem 7: Income Insecurity**
Some months: 45,000 KES. Other months: 8,000 KES. You can't plan your life. You can't support your family consistently. You're always stressed.

**The Emotional Toll:**

You're tired of:
- Feeling UNVALUED and DISRESPECTED
- Constant INCOME ANXIETY
- Wasted TIME and EFFORT
- Watching less-skilled workers get MORE jobs
- Feeling like your SKILLS DON'T MATTER

**You're Not Alone.**

This is the reality for HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of skilled technicians across Kenya:
- Plumbers
- Electricians
- Carpenters
- Welders
- Masons
- Painters
- HVAC technicians
- And dozens of other skilled trades

**The System is BROKEN. And It's NOT Your Fault.**

The problem isn't your skills. The problem isn't your work ethic. The problem is:

**There's No Infrastructure to Connect Your Skills to the Customers Who Need Them.**

Classifieds sites don't verify quality. Word-of-mouth doesn't scale. Directories don't have activity tracking.

You're operating in a market with NO trust, NO transparency, NO infrastructure.

**And it's costing you THOUSANDS of shillings every month.**

### O - OPPORTUNITY

**Enter Dumu Waks.**

**What if There Was a Better Way?**

**7:05am:** You tap "Accept."

**7:10am:** You chat with the customer via the app: "I'm on my way. Be there in 20 minutes."

**7:30am:** You arrive. You fix the pipe. Your Master-level skills mean it's PERFECT.

**8:00am:** Customer marks job complete.

**8:05am:** M-Pesa notification: "You've received 5,525 KES" (your 85% share of the 6,500 KES job).
